/**
 * Material 3 theme built on the episode6 orange.
 *
 * Dynamic colour is deliberately **not** supported: the brand colour is the point, and
 * event chips already carry each calendar's own colour, so a wallpaper-derived scheme
 * would leave the app with no identity of its own. Every neutral role a component can draw
 * with is set (see `Color.kt`), so nothing falls back to Material's baseline purple; the
 * error containers keep Material's own reds.
