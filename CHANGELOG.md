# Meeting Minder Changelog

### v1.0.0 - Unreleased

- Repo scaffold from the episode6 app-repo template: gradle wrapper (9.5.1),
  `settings.gradle.kts` + root `build.gradle.kts` with the derived-versionCode /
  snapshot-identity scheme, `self.versions.toml`, a version catalog, the `build-logic`
  included build with the `release-verification` convention plugin, the `:app` module
  (signing configs, build types, snapshot-aware resValues, licence-notice generation),
  the committed `debug.keystore`, an adaptive launcher icon with yellow debug / dark
  charcoal snapshot backgrounds, the episode6-orange Material 3 theme, all five CI
  workflows, the release scripts and the `.agents/` skills. `MainActivity` launches to
  a placeholder screen showing the app name.
- Internal: hardened the scaffold after review — the licence-notice unit test now
  compares the generated constant against the whole document instead of spot-checking
  it, the release signing config fails fast when only some of its keystore env vars are
  set, and `scripts/verify-docs-updated.sh` prints real newlines instead of literal
  `\n`.
- Internal: the pre-compose window theme now uses a platform `android:Theme.Material`
  parent instead of `Theme.Material3` from `com.google.android.material`, dropping that
  library and the View-system stack behind it (appcompat, fragment, recyclerview,
  constraintlayout, …) from the release dependency set.
